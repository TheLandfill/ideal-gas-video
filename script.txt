In some upcoming videos, I want to talk about practical applications of entropy.
I have decided to focus on an ideal gas, a gas where each particle acts
independently of all other particles. Focusing on such a gas can make our lives
much easier since we can figure out a pattern for one particle, then apply it
to all the particles.

So, what does it mean for each particle to be independent of all other
particles? In practice, it means two things:

1.	Particles take up zero space. The more space each particle takes up, the
	less space particles have to move. In the extreme case, the particles take
	up so much space that you no longer have a gas, but a liquid or a solid
	under extremely high pressure.
2.	Particles do not interact. With real gases, particles tend to want to stick
	together as a net result of the intermolecular forces, which include
	hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. In the extreme case, you again end
	up with liquids or solids.

While both of these requirements may seem too restrictive to apply to any real
gases, the ideal gas model approximates many gases quite well over a wide range
of temperatures, pressures, and volumes, and will serve as a starting point to
talk about thermodynamics.
